    heroContent: `Navarro County sits squarely in the Texas Blackland Prairies, a region stretching from San Antonio to the Red River known for its highly expansive Vertisol clay soils. This "black gumbo" soil contains smectite clay minerals that undergo dramatic volume changes with moisture fluctuations—expanding significantly when wet and shrinking when dry. For homeowners in Corsicana, Kerens, Blooming Grove, and throughout Navarro County, this means foundation problems are not a matter of if, but when.`,
    localContext: `The clay soils in Navarro County can exert pressures exceeding 5,000 pounds per square foot on foundation walls during expansion. Combined with our hot, dry summers followed by sudden heavy rains, foundations here experience stress cycles that foundations in other regions simply don't face. Many homes built in the 1950s through 1980s on post-tension slab foundations are now showing significant settling, with some areas of the county seeing foundation repairs needed on over 40% of homes older than 30 years.`,

**Interior Warning Signs:**
- Doors that stick, won't latch, or swing open on their own
- Cracks in drywall, especially diagonal cracks from door/window corners
- Gaps between walls and ceiling or walls and floor
- Uneven or sloping floors (place a ball on the floor—does it roll?)
- Cracks in tile flooring, especially in patterns radiating from corners
- Windows that are difficult to open or won't stay open

**Exterior Warning Signs:**
- Stair-step cracks in brick mortar joints
- Horizontal cracks in concrete block walls
- Gaps between the foundation and siding

        heading: "Foundation Repair Methods Used in Navarro County",
        content: `Different foundation problems require different solutions. Here's what you should know about the repair methods commonly used in our area:

**Pressed Concrete Pilings**
- Most common method in Navarro County
- Concrete cylinders driven deep into stable soil below the active clay layer
- Typically reaches 12-20 feet depth in our area
- Cost: $300-$500 per piling, most homes need 15-25 pilings
- Best for: Moderate settling on slab foundations

**Steel Piers (Push Piers)**
- Hydraulically driven steel tubes reaching bedrock or stable strata
- Can reach 30+ feet in Navarro County's deep clay profiles
- More expensive but provides strongest, most permanent solution
- Cost: $1,000-$1,500 per pier
- Best for: Severe settling, heavy structures, commercial buildings

**Helical Piers**
- Steel shafts with helical plates screwed into ground
- Work well in our variable soil conditions
- Can be installed in limited-access areas
- Cost: $1,200-$1,800 per pier
- Best for: Lighter structures, additions, areas with access limitations

**Pier and Beam Adjustments**
- For older Navarro County homes built on pier and beam foundations
- Shimming, replacing damaged beams, adding support piers
- Allows for under-house access and future adjustments
- Cost: $2,000-$5,000 for typical adjustments
- Best for: Pre-1960s homes, homes with crawl spaces

**Mudjacking/Slabjacking**
- Pumping material under slab to raise settled areas
- Temporary solution not recommended for active clay soils
- May need repeating every 5-10 years in our climate
- Cost: $500-$1,500 per section
- Not recommended for severe settling or structural issues`

        heading: "Why Navarro County Foundations Fail",
        content: `Understanding why foundations fail in our specific area helps you make better decisions about repairs and prevention.

**The Blackland Prairie Factor**
Navarro County's Vertisol soils contain up to 60% smectite clay, one of the most expansive clay types. When summer droughts hit—and our average August sees less than 2 inches of rain—this clay shrinks dramatically. Then when fall rains arrive (we average 4+ inches in October), the soil expands rapidly. This seasonal cycle creates enormous stress on foundations.

**Historical Construction Practices**
Many Navarro County homes built between 1950-1990 were constructed using building practices that didn't account for our extreme soil movement:
- Inadequate footer depth (many only 18 inches when 36+ inches is recommended)
- No or minimal steel reinforcement in slabs
- Poor drainage planning around foundations
- No root barriers near large trees

**Tree Root Influence**
Our beautiful live oaks and pecan trees—icons of Navarro County landscapes—can have root systems extending 50+ feet. These roots extract tremendous amounts of moisture from soil near foundations, causing localized shrinkage and differential settling. A single mature live oak can extract 50+ gallons of water daily from surrounding soil.

**Plumbing Leaks**
Older cast iron plumbing, common in pre-1970s Navarro County homes, often develops leaks under slabs. These hidden leaks create localized wet zones that cause soil expansion and heaving—pushing the foundation up rather than settling.`

        content: `While our soil makes some foundation movement inevitable, you can significantly reduce problems with proper maintenance:

**Maintain Consistent Moisture Levels**
- Install a soaker hose system 18 inches from your foundation
- Water foundation during drought (yes, water your foundation!)
- Run soaker hoses 15-30 minutes daily during dry periods
- Don't overwater—soggy soil is as bad as dry soil

**Manage Drainage**
- Ensure gutters direct water at least 5 feet from foundation
- Grade soil to slope away from foundation (6 inches per 10 feet)
- Consider French drains for low areas
- Don't let flower beds trap water against foundation

**Control Tree Roots**
- Install root barriers between large trees and foundation
- Consider removing trees within 20 feet of foundation
- Keep large trees well-watered during drought (draws roots away from foundation)

**Maintain Plumbing**
- Have plumbing leak detection performed every few years
- Address slow drains promptly (may indicate under-slab issues)
- Consider video inspection of sewer lines on homes 30+ years old

**Monitor Seasonally**
- Check for new cracks each spring and fall
- Document crack width with dated photos
- Note door/window operation changes
- Watch for new sticking points`

        question: "How much does foundation repair cost in Navarro County?",
        answer: "Foundation repair in Navarro County typically costs $4,000-$15,000 for residential homes, depending on the severity and number of piers needed. Minor repairs may run $2,000-$4,000, while severe settling requiring 20+ piers can exceed $20,000. Most companies offer free inspections and financing options."
      },
      {
        question: "Does homeowners insurance cover foundation repair in Texas?",
        answer: "Standard Texas homeowners insurance typically does not cover foundation repair due to settling or soil movement, as these are considered maintenance issues. However, if foundation damage results from a covered peril like a plumbing leak, that portion may be covered. Review your policy and consider foundation endorsements when renewing."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does foundation repair take?",
        answer: "Most Navarro County foundation repairs are completed in 1-3 days. Pier installation typically takes 1-2 days, with an additional day for cleanup and final adjustments. The foundation can bear full weight immediately after repair, though you should wait 7-10 days before making interior repairs to allow for any minor settling."
      },
      {
        question: "Will foundation repair fix all my cracks?",
        answer: "Foundation repair stabilizes and levels your foundation but doesn't automatically repair cosmetic damage. Most cracks won't worsen after repair, but existing drywall cracks, brick cracks, and stuck doors typically need separate repairs. Many foundation companies can recommend trusted contractors for these follow-up repairs."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it safe to buy a house with foundation issues in Navarro County?",
        answer: "Many Navarro County homes have had foundation repairs and are completely structurally sound. The key is getting a qualified foundation inspection before purchase, reviewing any repair warranties, and understanding what work was done. A properly repaired foundation can actually be more stable than an original foundation that hasn't shown problems yet."

    localContext: `Navarro County's hard water, with calcium carbonate levels averaging 180-250 ppm, accelerates mineral buildup in pipes and reduces water heater efficiency. Many homes on well water face even higher mineral content, often requiring specialized water treatment. Additionally, our expansive clay soils put constant stress on underground plumbing, making slab leaks a common and serious concern for homeowners throughout Corsicana, Kerens, and Blooming Grove.`,

        content: `Our local conditions create some plumbing challenges you won't find in other regions:

**Hard Water Damage**
Navarro County's naturally hard water leaves mineral deposits throughout your plumbing system:
- Water heater elements fail 30-40% faster than in soft water areas
- Showerheads and faucets clog with calcium buildup
- Dishwashers and washing machines require more maintenance
- White crusty deposits form on fixtures and shower doors

**Slab Leaks**
Our expansive Blackland Prairie soils shift constantly, stressing the copper and cast iron pipes running under and through concrete slabs:
- Watch for unexplained increases in water bills
- Warm spots on floors may indicate hot water line leaks
- Foundation cracks combined with water stains suggest slab leak
- Mold or mildew smells without visible source

**Cast Iron Pipe Deterioration**
Homes built before 1975 in Navarro County typically have cast iron drain pipes that are now 50+ years old:
- Bellied (sagging) pipe sections trap waste and cause backups
- Rust and corrosion create rough surfaces that catch debris
- Tree roots exploit small cracks in deteriorating joints
- Complete failure can cause sewage backup into home

**Septic System Challenges**
Many rural Navarro County properties rely on septic systems:
- Clay soil requires specialized drain field design
- Regular pumping crucial—every 3-5 years for most systems
- Heavy rain can cause system backup
- Old systems may not meet current code for home sales`

        content: `**Winter Freeze Protection**
While Navarro County doesn't see extended freezes often, when temperatures drop into the teens—as they did during the 2021 winter storm—unprotected pipes are at serious risk. Local plumbers recommend:
- Insulating exposed pipes in attics, crawl spaces, and exterior walls
- Knowing location of main water shut-off valve
- Keeping cabinet doors open under sinks during freezes
- Letting faucets drip during extended freezing periods
- Considering pipe heat tape for vulnerable areas

**Well Water Systems**
Rural Navarro County properties on well water face additional considerations:
- Pressure tank maintenance and replacement
- Well pump service (submersible or jet pump)
- Iron and sulfur treatment systems
- UV or chlorine treatment for bacteria
- Regular water quality testing

**Polybutylene Pipe Concerns**
Many Navarro County homes built between 1978-1995 have polybutylene (gray plastic) water supply lines. These pipes are known to fail and many insurers won't cover or will surcharge homes with poly pipes. A repipe to PEX or copper typically costs $4,000-$8,000 for an average home but may be required for insurance or home sales.`

Navarro County averages 230+ sunny days per year, making solar viable for many properties. Key considerations:
- Oncor interconnection requirements
- Net metering availability
- Roof orientation and shading
- Panel upgrade needs before solar installation

**Rural Property Challenges**
Properties outside Corsicana city limits may face:
- Longer runs from transformer (voltage drop concerns)
- Higher exposure to lightning-induced surges
- Need for taller service masts
- Agricultural electrical needs (wells, outbuildings, irrigation)

**Historic Home Wiring**
Downtown Corsicana and other historic areas have homes with original wiring:
- Knob-and-tube can be functional but limits insurance options
- Cloth wiring insulation deteriorates and becomes fire hazard
- Upgrades must often meet both current code and historic preservation standards`

    heroContent: `In Navarro County, your HVAC system isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. With summer temperatures regularly exceeding 100°F and over 2,700 cooling degree days annually, air conditioning runs nearly year-round. Finding a reliable HVAC contractor who understands our climate and homes is essential for comfort and managing energy costs.`,
    localContext: `Navarro County's climate presents unique HVAC challenges. Our humid subtropical conditions mean systems must handle both temperature and humidity control. The long cooling season—typically April through October—puts tremendous strain on equipment. Many older Corsicana homes have undersized ductwork designed for an era before central air, limiting system efficiency. Proper sizing and installation aren't just about comfort; they're about managing electricity bills that can exceed $300 monthly during peak summer.`,

        heading: "HVAC Challenges Specific to Navarro County",
        content: `**Extreme Cooling Demands**
With 80+ days above 90°F annually and heat indexes often exceeding 105°F, Navarro County AC systems work harder and longer than units in most of the country. This means:
- Compressors face 30% more run time than national averages
- Refrigerant systems are under constant high-pressure operation
- Air filters clog faster due to continuous operation
- Electrical components face more thermal stress

**Humidity Management**
Central Texas humidity, especially during spring and early summer, requires systems that effectively dehumidify:
- Oversized units cool quickly but don't run long enough to remove humidity
- Properly sized systems provide better humidity control
- Variable-speed systems excel in our climate
- Additional dehumidification may be needed in tight newer homes

**Dust and Allergens**
Navarro County's agricultural surroundings and Blackland Prairie soils create dusty conditions:
- Outdoor units require regular cleaning
- Higher-grade filters recommended (MERV 11-13)
- Ductwork should be inspected for leaks allowing dust infiltration
- Consider UV lights or air purifiers for allergy sufferers

**Power Quality Issues**
Rural areas of Navarro County experience voltage fluctuations that can damage HVAC equipment:
- Surge protectors recommended for outdoor units
- Hard-start kits extend compressor life
- Voltage monitors can prevent damage during brownouts`

        heading: "Choosing the Right System for Navarro County",
        content: `**Central Air Conditioner + Gas Furnace (Traditional)**
Most common in Navarro County. Gas furnace handles winter (natural gas widely available), AC handles summer.
- Pros: Proven technology, separate components, lower upfront cost
- Cons: Two systems to maintain, natural gas required
- Cost: $6,000-$12,000 installed

**Heat Pump (Dual Purpose)**
Single system provides both heating and cooling. Works well in our mild winters.
- Pros: Energy efficient, one system, works well to about 35°F
- Cons: Less efficient in coldest weather, may need auxiliary heat strips
- Cost: $7,000-$14,000 installed

**Mini-Split Systems (Ductless)**
Individual wall-mounted units for each zone. Good for additions, older homes, garages.
- Pros: No ductwork needed, zone control, very efficient
- Cons: Higher per-ton cost, visible interior units
- Cost: $3,000-$5,000 per zone

**Dual Fuel (Heat Pump + Gas Furnace)**
Heat pump handles moderate temperatures, furnace kicks in for coldest days. Premium efficiency.
- Pros: Most efficient option for our climate, best of both worlds
- Cons: Higher upfront cost, more complex system
- Cost: $10,000-$18,000 installed

**Geothermal**
Uses ground temperature for heating and cooling. Very efficient but high installation cost.
- Pros: Lowest operating cost, 25+ year life, quiet operation

        answer: "Service calls typically run $75-$125 plus repairs. Common repairs include capacitor replacement ($150-$300), contactor replacement ($150-$350), refrigerant recharge ($200-$500), and blower motor replacement ($400-$700).

      {
        question: "How often should I service my HVAC system?",
        answer: "In Navarro County's demanding climate, twice-yearly maintenance is recommended—once in spring before cooling season and once in fall before heating season. This includes coil cleaning, refrigerant check, electrical inspection, and filter replacement. Regular maintenance can extend equipment life by 5+ years and maintain efficiency."

      {
        question: "What size AC do I need for my Navarro County home?",
        answer: "A proper Manual J load calculation is essential—rules of thumb often result in oversized systems. Generally, Navarro County homes need 400-500 square feet per ton of cooling, but factors like insulation, window orientation, and ceiling height affect sizing. Oversized units short-cycle, failing to properly dehumidify."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do HVAC systems last in Texas?",
        answer: "Due to our long cooling season and high demand, Navarro County HVAC systems typically last 12-15 years versus 15-20 years in milder climates. Well-maintained systems can exceed this, while neglected units may fail in 8-10 years. If your system is 10+ years old and needs major repairs, consider replacement."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I replace my AC and furnace at the same time?",
        answer: "Generally, yes. Matched systems operate more efficiently and carry better warranties. If your furnace is over 15 years old when your AC fails, replacing both makes sense. However, if your furnace is under 10 years old and in good condition, you can replace just the AC with a compatible unit."

With our frequent hail storms, understanding the insurance process is essential:

*Documenting Damage:*
- Photograph damage immediately after storms
- Get professional inspection within 48 hours
- Don't make permanent repairs before adjuster visit
- Keep all damaged materials for inspection

*Insurance Inspection Process:*
- Request contractor be present during adjuster visit
- Adjuster may miss concealed damage—insist on thorough inspection
- Get independent inspection if you disagree with assessment
- Understand your policy's actual cash value vs. replacement cost terms

*Choosing a Storm Damage Contractor:*
- Beware of storm chasers with out-of-state plates
- Verify contractor is licensed and local
- Never sign assignment of benefits (AOB) without understanding implications
- Get multiple estimates before committing
- Avoid "free roof" claims—reputable contractors work with your insurance fairly

**Class 4 Shingle Insurance Discounts**
Texas Insurance Code requires insurers to offer discounts for Class 4 impact-resistant shingles. In Navarro County, these discounts typically range from 10-35% on the dwelling portion of your premium. For a home with $1,500 annual premium, this could save $150-$500 yearly—often paying for the upgrade within 5-7 years.`

        answer: "Consider replacement if your roof is over 15 years old, has widespread damage, has had multiple repairs, or you're seeing systemic issues like widespread granule loss. Repairs make sense for localized damage on newer roofs. A reputable contractor will give honest assessment—if they push replacement on a 5-year-old roof with minor damage, get another opinion."

After a storm, have your roof professionally inspected—damage may not be visible from ground level. Document everything and file claims promptly."

In Navarro County's expansive clay, fence posts should be set 30-36 inches deep minimum. Concrete footings help stabilize posts but must cure properly. Some installers use gravel drainage beneath concrete to reduce heaving. Steel posts may be preferred in areas with severe soil movement.

**Property Lines and Surveys**
Before installing a fence, know your exact property boundaries. Navarro County Appraisal District has property maps, but for expensive fencing, consider a professional survey. Discuss fence placement with neighbors—Texas law generally requires fences to be set on or inside your property line.

**HOA and City Requirements**
- City of Corsicana: Permits typically not required for residential fences under 8 feet, but check setback requirements
- HOA communities: May restrict fence height, style, and materials
- Pool fencing: Must meet Texas Health and Safety Code requirements (4+ feet height, self-closing gates)

**Utility Lines**
Call 811 before digging! Navarro County has underground utilities, especially in developed areas. Hitting a gas or electric line is dangerous and expensive.\`

Proper site preparation, adequate base material, and reinforcement are essential to prevent cracking and settling. Local contractors understand that our extreme temperature swings—from summer highs above 100°F to occasional winter freezes—require appropriate concrete mixes and finishing techniques. Timing pours to avoid rapid evaporation in summer heat is also critical.`,

Our clay soils require:
- Removal of organic material and topsoil
- Compacted fill or base material (4"+ crushed limestone)
- Proper drainage away from concrete
- Allowance for soil movement

**Reinforcement Options**
- Wire mesh: Basic reinforcement for light-duty applications
- Rebar: Stronger, required for driveways and high-load areas

- Post-tension cables: For foundations (specialty work)

**Weather Considerations**
- Avoid pouring in extreme heat (rapid evaporation)
- Protect fresh concrete from rain
- Winter pours require precautions below 40°F
- Curing compounds essential in our climate

**Maintenance Tips**
- Seal concrete every 2-3 years
- Keep drainage clear
- Avoid deicing chemicals (rare need here)
- Address cracks promptly before they spread\`

        question: "How much does concrete work cost in Navarro County?",
        answer: "Basic concrete (plain gray, broom finish) runs $8-$12 per square foot installed. Colored or stamped concrete costs $12-$18 per square foot. A typical 20x20 foot driveway (400 sq ft) costs $3,200-$4,800 for basic work, $4,800-$7,200 for decorative. Removal of old concrete adds $2-$4 per square foot. Always get itemized quotes."

        question: "How long does concrete take to cure?",
        answer: "Concrete reaches about 70% strength in 7 days and full strength at 28 days. You can typically walk on new concrete after 24-48 hours and drive on it after 7 days. However, heavy loads should wait 28 days. Proper curing (keeping it moist) is crucial, especially in Texas heat—your contractor should apply curing compound or water cure."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does concrete crack?",
        answer: "Some cracking is normal in concrete—control joints are placed to direct where cracks occur. Excessive or random cracking usually results from: poor soil preparation, inadequate base material, insufficient reinforcement, improper curing, extreme temperature changes, or tree root pressure. Our clay soils make proper preparation especially important."

        question: "How much does commercial cleaning cost?",
        answer: "Commercial cleaning rates depend on space size, cleaning frequency, and services needed. Small offices (under 2,000 sq ft) typically run $150-$400 monthly for regular cleaning. Larger facilities negotiate per-square-foot rates, often $0.05-$0.20/sq ft. Specialized services like floor care and window cleaning are usually priced separately."

They're usually more cost-effective than full-time employees for most businesses. However, large facilities with constant cleaning needs might benefit from in-house staff. Consider your space size, budget, and management capacity."

Contractors specialize in specific trades (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) requiring licenses, and they handle larger projects with permits. If a project involves structural changes, new electrical circuits, or significant plumbing, you likely need a licensed contractor."

        answer: "Ask neighbors and friends for recommendations—word of mouth is valuable in a community like Navarro County. Check online reviews. Ask about insurance coverage. Start with a small project to test reliability before committing to larger work. Good handymen are often booked out, so plan ahead for non-emergency work."

        question: "Can I replace a garage door spring myself?",
        answer: "Garage door springs are under extreme tension and can cause serious injury if mishandled.

While extension springs (along the sides) are somewhat safer, professional repair is still strongly recommended for safety."

        question: "How long do garage door springs last?",
        answer: "Standard garage door springs are rated for about 10,000 cycles (one open and one close = one cycle). For a typical family using the door 4 times daily, that's about 7 years. Heavy use shortens lifespan. When one spring breaks, the other often follows soon—many technicians recommend replacing both at once."

        answer: "During peak growing season (April-October), weekly mowing is typical. Never remove more than 1/3 of blade height at once. In extreme heat, mowing every 10-14 days may be better to reduce stress. Winter dormancy allows monthly or as-needed mowing. Adjust height seasonally—higher in summer, lower in spring and fall."

        answer: "Review policies annually or when major life changes occur: buying a home, marriage, having children, starting a business, major purchases, or reaching retirement.

        answer: "Standard homeowners insurance does NOT cover flood damage. If you're in a FEMA-designated flood zone, your mortgage lender will require flood insurance. Even outside designated zones, flooding can occur—over 25% of flood claims come from low-risk areas. Navarro County properties near creeks, Richland Chambers, or low-lying areas should consider flood coverage."

For out-of-pocket repairs, getting 2-3 estimates helps ensure fair pricing. Be wary of estimates significantly lower than others—quality shops use quality parts and proper repair procedures."

Severe driving conditions (towing, extreme heat, dusty roads—common in Navarro County) may warrant more frequent changes. When in doubt, more frequent changes won't hurt."

        answer: "For most modern vehicles, yes. Synthetic oil performs better in extreme temperatures, resists breakdown longer, and can extend change intervals. It's required for many newer vehicles. The longer intervals often offset the higher per-quart cost. For older vehicles with conventional oil, continuing with conventional is usually fine."

If possible, get puppies accustomed to handling paws, ears, and tail. Consistency with the same groomer helps pets become comfortable with the process."

        answer: "Extensions last through your natural lash cycle—typically 4-6 weeks. However, fills are needed every 2-3 weeks to maintain a full look as natural lashes shed. With regular maintenance, you can keep extensions indefinitely. Proper aftercare extends the time between fills."

        answer: "Yes. Even first DWI carries serious consequences: jail time, fines, license suspension, and a permanent criminal record. A skilled attorney may be able to get charges reduced, identify problems with the stop or testing, or achieve dismissal. The costs of conviction far exceed attorney fees."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I can't afford a lawyer?",
        answer: "If you can't afford an attorney, you can request a court-appointed lawyer. Navarro County provides appointed counsel for defendants who qualify financially. However, you may want to explore payment plans with private attorneys who can dedicate more time and resources to your case."

      {
        question: "Will a criminal charge show up on background checks?",
        answer: "Arrests may show up even without conviction. Convictions appear on background checks for employers, landlords, and licensing boards. Some charges can be expunged (erased) or sealed from records if the case was dismissed or you completed deferred adjudication. Ask your attorney about expunction eligibility."

        answer: "Most personal injury lawyers work on contingency—they take a percentage (typically 33-40%) of your settlement or verdict, plus costs. You pay nothing upfront and nothing if you don't recover. This arrangement makes legal help accessible when you're already dealing with injury expenses."

        answer: "Common causes include: low refrigerant (leak), dirty filters restricting airflow, frozen evaporator coil, faulty compressor, thermostat issues, or electrical problems. Check and change your filter first. If that doesn't help, call for professional diagnosis."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does AC repair cost?",
        answer: "Service calls run $75-$150 for diagnosis. Common repairs cost $150-$500 (capacitor, fan motor, refrigerant). Major repairs like compressors run $1,200-$2,500. Emergency and after-hours service costs more. If repairs exceed 50% of replacement cost, consider a new system."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I repair or replace my AC?",
        answer: "Consider replacement if: the system is over 15 years old, uses R-22 refrigerant (being phased out), requires frequent repairs, or repair costs exceed 50% of new unit price. Newer systems are significantly more efficient, reducing operating costs."

      {
        question: "How much does flooring installation cost?",
        answer: "Material costs vary: LVP $2-$7/sq ft, laminate $1-$5/sq ft, tile $2-$15/sq ft, hardwood $4-$12/sq ft. Installation adds $2-$6/sq ft depending on complexity. A typical room costs $1,500-$4,000 for materials and installation."

      {
        question: "How long does flooring installation take?",
        answer: "An average room takes 1-2 days. Whole-house installation takes 3-7 days depending on size and flooring type. Tile takes longer than LVP or laminate. Add time for removing old flooring and any subfloor repair needed."

        question: "Should bees be killed or removed alive?",
        answer: "Live removal is preferred when possible. Bees are critical pollinators facing population challenges. Humane removal relocates the colony to an apiary where they continue producing honey and pollinating crops. Extermination is sometimes necessary for aggressive Africanized bees."
      },
      {
        question: "Why shouldn't I remove bees myself?",
        answer: "Bee removal requires protective equipment and knowledge of bee behavior. Disturbing hives without proper technique can trigger defensive attacks—dangerous even for non-allergic individuals. Some Texas bees are Africanized and extremely aggressive. Leave removal to professionals."

        question: "Will I be asleep during oral surgery?",
        answer: "Options include local anesthesia (numb but awake), sedation (relaxed/drowsy), or general anesthesia (asleep). Your surgeon recommends appropriate anesthesia based on the procedure and your comfort level. Sedation and general anesthesia require a driver home."

      {
        question: "How long is recovery from wisdom teeth removal?",
        answer: "Most people return to normal activities in 3-5 days. Complete healing takes 1-2 weeks. Swelling peaks at 48-72 hours and gradually subsides. Follow post-operative instructions carefully—dry socket is preventable but painful. Stock up on soft foods beforehand."
