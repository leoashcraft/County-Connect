            body: `Navarro County was established in 1846 and named in honor of **Jose Antonio Navarro**, a Texas patriot and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. Navarro was one of only two native-born Texans to sign the declaration and played a crucial role in Texas's fight for independence.

<br>

The county seat, Corsicana, was founded in 1848 and named after the Mediterranean island of Corsica—the birthplace of Jose Antonio Navarro's father. The city grew steadily as an agricultural center, but its destiny changed dramatically in 1894.

<br>

### The First Texas Oil Boom

In 1894, while drilling for water, workers accidentally struck oil in Corsicana, leading to the **first commercially significant oil discovery in Texas**. This discovery preceded the famous Spindletop gusher by seven years and established Corsicana as a pioneer in Texas's oil industry. A refinery was operational by 1899, and the discovery helped fuel the broader Texas oil boom that would transform the state's economy.

<br>

### World War II Era

During World War II, Corsicana Air Field trained thousands of military pilots, contributing to the war effort and bringing economic activity to the region. The legacy of aviation training continues today with the presence of general aviation facilities in the county.`

            body: `Navarro County offers exceptional opportunities for outdoor recreation, anchored by two major reservoirs that rank among Texas's finest.

<br>

### Richland-Chambers Reservoir

Spanning 64.62 square miles with over 1.1 million acre-feet of water capacity, **Richland-Chambers Reservoir** ranks as Texas's third-largest reservoir by surface area and eighth-largest by volume. Created by impounding Richland Creek and Chambers Creek in 1987, this massive body of water stretches across both Navarro and Freestone counties east of Corsicana and south of Kerens.

The reservoir has earned a reputation as one of Texas's premier fishing destinations, particularly for catfish. It holds the state record for blue catfish at an impressive 121.5 pounds. Anglers also enjoy outstanding catches of largemouth bass, white bass, and crappie. Multiple marinas, boat ramps, and guide services make the lake accessible to both casual visitors and serious anglers.

<br>

### Navarro Mills Lake

**Navarro Mills Lake**, a 5,070-acre U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoir, was created in 1963 by damming Richland Creek near the community of Purdon. Originally built for flood control and water supply, the lake has become a beloved recreation destination for Navarro County residents and visitors.

The lake features eight distinct recreation areas managed by the Corps of Engineers, including Wolf Creek Park, Oak Park, and Liberty Hill. These areas offer boat ramps, swimming beaches, picnic facilities, and well-maintained campgrounds with electrical hookups. Popular fish species include largemouth bass, channel catfish, white bass, and crappie.

<br>

### Lake Halbert

Closer to downtown Corsicana, **Lake Halbert** provides a scenic 650-acre retreat with a beautiful surrounding park, swimming beach, walking trails, and fishing opportunities. The lake is perfect for kayaking and paddle sports, as only electric motors are permitted.

<br>

### Parks & Trails

The county features numerous parks and recreational facilities throughout its communities. Jester Park offers playgrounds, walking trails, and a seasonal splash pad. Lake Halbert Park provides miles of scenic trails around the lake. Downtown Corsicana's pocket park offers an urban retreat with murals and water features.

<br>

### Community Events

Throughout the year, Navarro County communities host festivals, farmers markets, holiday celebrations, and cultural events that bring residents together and celebrate local heritage.`

The Starlink dish (called "Dishy") automatically finds and tracks satellites overhead. Just plug it in, point it at the sky, and you're online. The included app walks you through setup in about 15 minutes.`
